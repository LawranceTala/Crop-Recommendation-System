# Crop-Recommendation-System
 This project recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. It uses a machine learning model trained on real agricultural data and provides predictions through a FastAPI backend with a ReactJS frontend interface.
